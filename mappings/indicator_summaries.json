This upper bound represents the top end of the statistically likely range for the country's true governance performance, providing a measure of the margin of error."

    "description": "Represents the standard error for the Regulatory Quality governance estimate, which is part of the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). The standard error measures the precision of the governance score, with larger values indicating greater statistical uncertainty. The underlying Regulatory Quality estimate reflects perceptions of the government's capacity to create policies that support private sector growth. This metric is fundamental for constructing confidence intervals around the main estimate and assessing the significance of changes or cross-country differences."
